# Unstable-Blowup-NLS
This repository contains the code for the paper "Mechanisms of unstable blowup in a quadratic nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation". Some parts are written in Mathematica, and other parts are written in MATLAB. 

Most of the MATLAB code uses the Chebfun package, which will need to be downloaded and added to MATLAB's path. See:
https://www.chebfun.org/docs/guide/

To run the numerical simulations described in the paper, one should run the following programs to 
Matlab_Github/Blowup_and_relative_Modes/

spinOP_Fourier
process_data

After one has created the data files with the above method, then each of the figures in the paper were created with the respective files below:
